Football Match Visualization
This project simulates a real-time football match dashboard where you can visualize player movements, track the ball, and display match events such as goals, fouls, and substitutions. The football pitch and player movement are rendered dynamically, and events are displayed periodically to simulate a real football match.

Key Features:
Live Football Pitch Animation: A dynamic representation of a football pitch.

Real-Time Player Movement: Players randomly move within the pitch boundaries.

Ball Tracking: The ball follows the player who has possession.

Event Overlays: Events like goals, fouls, and substitutions are displayed periodically.

Animations: Smooth transitions for player movement and event overlays.



Technologies Used:
HTML: Basic structure of the dashboard and pitch.

CSS: Styled with Tailwind CSS for responsive design and animations.

JavaScript: Logic for player movement, event simulation, and ball tracking.
